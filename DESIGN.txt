Reset Condition:
	1) reset after hitting the ground and x seconds have passed.
	2) movement (velocity) is below some threshold.
	3) when player is touched, this way you can't accidently trap him.

Blocks:
	Add number to blocks placed in the world to indicate undo ordering
	Bounce and Wood so far have same logic but other blocks may not.  Additionally need a "contacted" method for sound, animation, etc.
	Accel adds too much of a randomness factor, maybe limit max velocity.

Hud:
	Number in corner of each block button to indicate number of blocks left

Buttons:
	Enlarge slightly when action down, decrease to normal on action up.
		- provides some sort of feedback for when buttons are pressed

Position markers:
	Allow players to place flags to remember positions.  

Obstacles
	Destructables?

Mechanics
	Some sort of scoring mechanism?  Airtime?  Num blocks used? 

Graphics
	Consider remaking everything in Okami-esque style.  Would look quite nice for this kind of game.  Style kind of hard to emulate though.

Animations
	Ease functions for movement. Most text?
